## Getting existing Extensions & Settings of VSCode into repo

> To make new settings stay with you, fork the repo and then commit changes after running this script in your forked repo

### Linux

[Store VSCode's Current Settings](#store-vscodes-current-settings-into-repo) Script can also be using to get existing Extensions & Settings. Alternate way of doing it is given below.

### Windows / Mac / Linux

1. Extensions : Run `code --list-extensions` in terminal (Mac) / CMD (Win) and overwrite contents of [vscode-extensions](./VSCode-Config/vscode-extensions.txt) with the output you get by running that command.
2. Open VSCode and go to Settings (Ctrl+,) and Click the Icon {} on top right corner. Copy all the contents under USER SETTINGS and replace the contents of [settings](./VSCode-Config/settings.json) file VSCode Config Folder with copied contents.

## To Do

- Add installation by downloading debian package from github repo's releases
- Also write script to download Vagrant from Official site, not the unofficial PPA (if possible)
- Use the official PPA mentioned on VirtualBox site instead of using the apt's virtualbox, as it is mostly outdated and it is possible to get updates using official PPA
